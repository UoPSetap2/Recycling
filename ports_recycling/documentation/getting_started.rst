Getting Started
===============

This section provides instructions on how to install and start using the Portsmouth Recycling App.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can run the Portsmouth Recycling App, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Dart: The programming language used to develop the app.
- Flutter: The UI toolkit used to build the app.
- A mobile environment emulator: This could be part of an IDE like Android Studio or a standalone tool.

Installation
------------

To install the Portsmouth Recycling App on your development machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the necessary dependencies.
4. Start your mobile environment emulator.
5. Run `flutter run` to start the app in the emulator.

Remember to keep your emulator running while you're using the app.

We hope to be able to publish it onto the app store eventually, but for now, you will need to run it locally.
